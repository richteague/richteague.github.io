    A suite of tools written in Python to extract kinematical information from spectrally resolved line emission in protoplanetary disks. <mark>eddy</mark> has been used to [infer the presence of unseen planets](https://public.nrao.edu/news/2018-alma-proto-trio/) and make the first confirmation of [grain trapping in pressure maxima](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018ApJ...868..113T/abstract).

    Tired of having to play around with masks and clipping thresholds to get a nice looking rotation or emission map? <mark>bettermoments</mark> is here to help!

    This is a simple package written with [Dan Foreman-Mackey](https://dfm.io/) to quickly make moment maps from position-position-velocity cubes without the need for clipping. And, as a bonus, returns uncertainties! A short article about this method used can be found at the [Research Notes of the AAS](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/aae265/meta).
