      <p>
          When, where and how do planetary systems form? These are the questions my research aims to answers.
          I tackle these questions primarily with sub-mm interometric observations of the gas and dust in protoplanetary disks, the birthplace of planets.
          Below, I briefly describe the main broad themes of my research.
      </p>

      <br/>
        <h4>Detecting the Youngest Exoplanets</h4>
      <br/>

      <p>
          If we are to really understand the planet formation process, we must first find the still-forming planets.
          We have recently made the <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/news/2019-alma-circumplanetary/">first detection of a circumplanetary disk</a>, a disk around a still-forming planet believed to be the source for moons.
          This work continues to push the boundaries for what is possible with the Atacama Large (sub-)Milimeter Array (ALMA).
          However, as this approach is only applicable to the inner disk where large, mm sized grains exist, I am developing methods to understand the limits of what we are able to detect from the gas.
          By searching for local disturbances in the rotation speed of the gas, we are finding a <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...884L..56T/abstract">stunning variety of kinematical substructures</a>, indicative of a large population of of sitll-forming planets.
          Follow-up observations with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and future 'extremely large' ground-based telescopes will allow us to directly probe the atmospheres of these planets and understand how key organic species are delivered to them.

      <br/>
        <h4>The 6D Structure of the Planet Formation Environment</h4>
      <br/>

      <p>
          The unparalleled spatial resolution afforded by ALMA has enabled a unique view of the 6D (three spatial dimensions and three velocity dimensions) structure of a protoplanetary disk.
          For example, using a newly developed technique, we have been able to infer <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/news/gas-waterfalls-reveal-infant-planets-around-young-star/">the first 3D velocity map of a disk</a>, confirming the presence of 'meridional flows'.
          Such flows are an efficient way to transport material from the disk atmosphere to the planet-forming midplane and will have large implication for the chemical processes which takes place during the planet formation process.
          In parallel, I am working on techniques to measure empirical 2D temperature structures, a fundamental property of disks which strongly influences to the pace and efficiency of planet formation.
      </p>


      <br/>
        <h4>Molecular Excitation and Polarization</h4>
      <br/>

      <p>
          While protoplanetary disks do not show the chemical complexity found in earlier phases of star formation, the molecules which are detected provide a tremendous amount of information about the underlying physical and chemical structures.
          I am interested in using molecular excitation to infer physical properties of the disk, such as the gas temperature, density or ionization level.
          By exploiting our astrochemical knowledge, we can use different molecules to trace different regions in the disk and unravel the full structure of the disk.
          We have used this technique to <a href="https://www.mpia.de/henning/press-releases/2017-01-twhydrae-disk">trace perturbations in the disk of TW Hya</a>, connecting to features observed with the scattered light.
          I have also been adapting techniques used to detect weak molecular emission to search for weakly polarized molecular line emission.
          The detection of polarized line emission provides a direct probe of the underlying magnetic fields in a disk, a propery that has hitherto remained elusive.
